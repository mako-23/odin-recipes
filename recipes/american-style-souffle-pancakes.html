		<h1>American-Style Souffle Pancakes<h1>
		<img src="../images/american-pancake.webp">
		<p>These easy-to-make soufflé pancakes use the same basic technique as their extremely trendy Japanese cousins, but are much easier, don't require a mold, and actually taste like pancakes. The fully inflated version just isn't dense enough to satisfy me as a pancake, and mostly makes me want to bake actual soufflés. Top with maple syrup and powdered sugar if desired.</p>
